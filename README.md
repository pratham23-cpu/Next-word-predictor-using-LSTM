In this project we have Developed a next word prediction model to enhance text
prediction capabilities which used LSTM (Long Short Term Memory),NLP (Natural Language Processing),TenserFlow to predict the next word based on the previous sequence of words the model was trained
and tested on EBOOK dataset giving 97.8% accuracy
